# Response Reporting Dashboard

## Goal: 
Build a dashboard to monitor Disinformation Reports and Response Times in Social Media Platforms, using Plotly and Dash. 
- Use this repo to work on the dashboard together or create your own repo to build your own dashboard.

## Problem:
When citizens flag content on very large online platforms (VLOPS) as disinformation or scam/frauds , the social media platforms respond that they will investigate and take action if needed. However, it is very challenging to follow up on the actions taken by these platforms. The main challenge is the lack of a tracking system to: 1) measure the number of reports made; 2) measure the follow-up actions taken in response and 3) measure the time it takes for VLOPS to answer those reports.

## Solution: 
[VOST Europe](https://vosteurope.org/), as a signatory of the Code of Practice on Disinformation, would like us to build a tracking app to monitor the response, and response times of VLOPS, to flags made by non-VLOPS’ signatories of the Code of Practice on Disinformation. The app will be used by VOST volunteers to create the reports and track all the subsequent actions taken by the VLOPS.

## Timeline:
April 1 to April 30.
