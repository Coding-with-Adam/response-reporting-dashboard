# Structure of Response Reporting Dashboard
You can either use this repo to work on the dashboard together or create your own repo and design your own dashboard.

However, at minimum, to be considered by VOST Europe the dashboard should include the following elements:

- An internal-facing page ([see example](https://github.com/Coding-with-Adam/response-reporting-dashboard/blob/main/iternal.py)) that vetted volunteers will use to note social media reports:
    - Vetted user (predefined list)
    - Social media platform being reported (predefined list)
    - Link of content being reported
    - Report type (predefined list)
    - Time of report made
    - Response type (predefined list)
    - Response notes
    - Time of response

- an external-facing page that offers data visualizations on all the reports. At minimum it should include visualizations on:
    - Total reports grouped by social media platform
    - Type of report grouped by platform
    - Average response time grouped by platform
    - Reportsâ€™ response grouped by platform
